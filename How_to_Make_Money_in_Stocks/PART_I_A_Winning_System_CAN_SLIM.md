## INTRODUCTION You Must Learn and Benfit from America's 100 Years of Super Winners

After the market debacles of 2000 eand 2008, investors now realize they must take charge and learn much more about what they're doing when they save and invest their hard-earned money. However, many investors don't know where to turn, whom to trust, or what they must stop doing in order to achieve true superior investment performance.

You don't have to give your money to a Bernie Madoff, who'll take it but won't tell you eactly what he's doing with it. Instead, you need to read a few of the best investment books, attend some investment classes, or participate in an investment meet-up group so you can learn how to invest with knowledge and confidence. At the very least, you need to learn and understand well the sound principles, proven rules and methods that can protect and build your investment profolio over time. Half of all Americans save and invest; now it's time to learn to do it intelligently with critical known-how. 

When I started investing, I made most of the same mistakes you've probably made. But here's what I've learned:

- You buy stocks when they're on the way up in price, not on the way down. And when you buy more, you do it only after the stock has risen from your purchase price, not after it has fallen below it.

- You buy stocks when they're nearer to their highs for the year, not when they've sunk lower and look cheap. You buy higher-priced, better quality stocks rather than the lowest-priced stocks.

- You learn to always sell stocks quickly when you have a small 7 or 8% loss rather than waiting and hoping they'll come bnack. Many don't.

- You pay far less attention to a company's book value, dividends, or PE ratio - which for the last 100 years have had little predictive value in spotting America's most successful companies - and focus instead on vital historically proven factors such as strong earnings and sales growth, price and volume action, and whether the company is the number one profit leader in its field with a superior new product.

- You don't subscribe to a bunch or market newsletters or advisory services, and you don't let yourself be influenced by recommendations from analysts, or friends who, after all, are just expressing personal opinions that can frequently be wrong and prove costly.
